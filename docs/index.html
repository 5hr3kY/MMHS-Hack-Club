        <p id = "about"> Hack Club is a national programming club made by teens, for teens.
            At Murrieta Mesa, our hack club is meant for any student interested in computer 
            science! Hacking is a term used for creation, not just intercepting security protocols 
            (silly).<br><br> It was made for creating a community in Mesa interested in programming!
            No experience is required at all to join the club.
            There'll be a lot of resources to learn from during workshops and hakcathons!
            You'll gain rewards after every project you create!
            <br><br> Scroll down to see more about what happens in our club!
